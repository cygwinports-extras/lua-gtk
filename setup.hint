ldesc: "Lua-Gtk provides a complete binding to Gtk 2.x for Lua. With it, 
you can write small or large applications only in Lua, while using Gtk 
through an API that almost matches the C API. All of the over 5500 
functions and 700 structures, unions and enums are available. Still, the 
library is just about 200 kB when compiled (plus a few small Lua 
files)."
